    Version
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    100       Initial version
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    101       OpenSocket() modified: remote and local port are now 2 bytes wide
              RcvData() modified: if "NO CARRIER" string is detected between 
              received data(= socket has been closed), status of communication 
              line is automatically changed from DATA to FREE state
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    102       GPRS is a part of GSM class to avoid repeated inheritance in future
              (in case other module will be added, like GPS)
