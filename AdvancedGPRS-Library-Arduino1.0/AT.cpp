    History
    ---------------------------------
    This library was based on the GSM-Library from www.hwkitchen.com for Telit modules.
    Some functions came from the sserial2mobile (http://code.google.com/p/sserial2mobile/)
    Modified by Kostas Sigalas (www.sigalabs.com) to support the SIMCOM SIM900 module series
	and SiGAlabs Advanced GPRS Shield on-board functionalities.
	
    Library Version
    ------------------------------------
	BETA    (010) 0.10   First public beta
						 Supports Power-on, SMS messaging, Voice Calls and basic functionality.
	BETA	(011) 0.11	 Battery charge monitoring functions added.			 
	
	
	
	TO-DO
    ---------------------------------
    - RX/TX-Pin should be realised with Softserial or normal Serial.

/**********************************************************
Two methods print out debug information to the standard output
- it means to the serial line.
First method prints string.
Second method prints integer numbers.

Note:
=====
The serial line is connected to the GSM module and is 
used for sending AT commands. There is used "trick" that GSM
module accepts not valid AT command strings because it doesn't
understand them and still waits for some valid AT command.
So after all debug strings are sent we send just AT<CR> as
a valid AT command and GSM module responds by OK. So previous 
debug strings are overwritten and GSM module is not influenced
by these debug texts 


string_to_print:  pointer to the string to be print out
last_debug_print: 0 - this is not last debug info, we will
                      continue with sending... so don't send
                      AT<CR>(see explanation above)
                  1 - we are finished with sending debug info 
                      for this time and finished AT<CR> 
                      will be sent(see explanation above)
